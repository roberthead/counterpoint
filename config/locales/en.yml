          Counterpoint is the interplay of multiple melodic lines that has a harmonic effect.
        </p>
          Historically, there are two main styles of traditional counterpoint â€” sixteenth-century (Renaissance) counterpoint, exemplified by Palestrina, and eighteenth-century (Baroque) counterpoint, exemplified by J. S. Bach. The technique is, consequently, of interest to students of classical music and to composers.

          Johann Joseph Fux published a seminal pedagogical work on the topic of counterpoint in 1725 called <span class="work-title">Gradus ad Parnassum</span>. This book introduced 'species counterpoint', which is a series of five compositional exercises in which a <span class="foreign-word">cantus firmus</span> (a 'fixed song' or starting melody) is provided and the student writes a counterpoint line against it.
